# Theory of Languages and Automata Project

## Overview

This project is part of my *Theory of Languages and Automata* course. It covers foundational topics such as finite automata, regular languages, grammars, and pushdown automata. The project is divided into two parts: a half-term project and a final project, each containing multiple phases that explore different aspects of automata theory and formal languages.

## Half-Term Project

The half-term project focuses on finite automata (FA) and regular languages. It is broken down into the following phases:

### 1. Convert NFA to DFA
In this phase, we convert a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The conversion involves constructing a DFA that accepts the same language as the NFA.

### 2. Simplification of DFA
The DFA obtained from the first phase is simplified by removing unnecessary states and transitions, resulting in a minimal DFA that accepts the same language.

### 3. Check if a String is Accepted on a FA
In this phase, the program checks whether a given string is accepted by the finite automaton (DFA or NFA).

### 4. Perform an Operation on a Regular Language
We perform operations (such as union, intersection, complement) on regular languages and represent the resulting languages as finite automata.

### 5. Convert FA to Regex using Arden's Lemma
This phase involves converting a finite automaton (FA) into an equivalent regular expression using Arden's Lemma.

## Final Project

The final project shifts focus to context-free grammars (CFGs) and pushdown automata (PDA), expanding the scope to include more complex computational models.

### 1. Check if a String is Accepted on a Grammar
We verify whether a given string belongs to the language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG).

### 2. Check if a String is Accepted on a PDA
This phase involves checking whether a string is accepted by a Pushdown Automaton (PDA), a more powerful computational model compared to FA.

### 3. Convert NPDA to CFG
In this phase, we convert a Non-deterministic Pushdown Automaton (NPDA) into an equivalent Context-Free Grammar (CFG).
